# Beautiful Jekyll

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal blogs or simple project websites.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join) - it takes one minute. This is where your website will live - if you sign up with username `johnsmith` then your website will be `http://johnsmith.github.io`.  
- It would be helpful to understand what Markdown is and how to write it. Markdown is just a way to take a piece of text and format it to look a little nicer.  For example, this whole instruction set that you're reading is written in markdown - it's just text with some words being bold/larger/italicized/etc. I recommend taking 5 minutes to learn markdown [with this amazingly easy yet useful tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

## Build your website in 3 steps

Getting started is *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :smile:   
Scroll down to see the steps involved, but here is a 40-second video just as a reference as you work through the steps.

![Installation steps](img/install-steps.gif)

### 1. Fork this repository

(Assuming you are on this page and logged into GitHub) Fork this repository by clicking the *Fork* button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account.

### 2. Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at `http://<yourusername>.github.io` within a couple minutes.  To do this, click on *Settings* at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename.

### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site. To edit the file, click on it and then click on the pencil icon (watch the video tutorial above if you're confused).  The settings in the file are fairly self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you further. Any line that begins with a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, and the rest of the lines are actual settings.

Another way to edit the config file (or any other file) is to use [prose.io](http://prose.io/), which is just a simple interface to allow you to more intuitively edit files or add new files to your project.

After you save your changes to the config file (by clicking on *Commit changes* as the video tutorial shows), your website should be ready in a minute or two at `http://<yourusername>.github.io`. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated in about a minute or so.

You can now visit your shiny new website, which will be seeded with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages. Your website is at `http://<yourusername>.github.io` (replace `<yourusername>` with your user name). Do not add `www` to the URL - it will not work!

**Note:** The video above goes through the setup for a user with username `daattalitest`. I only edited one setting in the `_config.yml` file in the video, but **you should actually go through the rest of the settings as well. Don't be lazy, go through all the settings :)**

## Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file directly.  It is much easier to write markdown than HTML, so I suggest you do that (use the [tutorial I mentioned above](http://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown). You can look at some files on this site to get an idea of how to write markdown. To look at existing files, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md). On the next page you can see some nicely formatted text (there is a word in bold, a link, bullet points), and if you click on the pencil icon to edit the file, you will see the markdown that generated the pretty text. Very easy!

In contrast, look at [`index.html`](./index.html). That's how your write HTML - not as pretty. So stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.

Any file that you add inside the [`_posts`](./_posts) directory will be treated as a blog entry.  You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts.  After you successfully add your own post, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](./_posts) to remove the sample posts, as those are just demo posts to help you learn.

As mentioned previously, you can use [prose.io](http://prose.io/) to add or edit files instead of doing it directly on GitHub, it can be a little easier that way.

## Creating a User Page vs a Project Page

If you're not sure what the difference is, you can probably safely ignore this section.

If you want to use this theme to host a website that will be available at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`, then you do not need to read this section. That is called a User Page, you can only have one User Page in your GitHub account, and it is what you get by default when forking this project.

If you want to use this theme to create a website for a particular repository, it will be available at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/REPONAME`, and that is called a [Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/). You can have a Project Page for each repository you have on GitHub. There are two important things to note when creating a project page:

1. In the configuration file (`_config.yml`), you should set `baseurl` to be `/projectname` instead of `""`.
2. Project Pages are served from a branch named `gh-pages`, and you should be generating all the website content on that branch. When you fork Beautiful Jekyll, you'll already have a `gh-pages` branch but you should delete it and generate it again from the `master` branch. The reason is that the `gh-pages` branch in its current form does not have the updated code of Beautiful Jekyll, so you need to create that branch from the `master` branch (which is where all my new features and work go into).

## Credits

This template was not made entirely from scratch. I would like to give special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.
- [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia) and their project [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from which I've used some design ideas and some of the templating code for posts and pagination.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.

## Contributions

If you find anything wrong or would like to contribute in any way, feel free to create a pull request/open an issue/send me a message.  Any comments are welcome!

Thank you to [all contributors](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/graphs/contributors). Special thanks to the following people with non-trivial contributions (in chronological order): [@hristoyankov](https://github.com/hristoyankov), [@jamesonzimmer](https://github.com/jamesonzimmer), [@XNerv](https://github.com/XNerv), [@epwalsh](https://github.com/epwalsh), [@rtlee9](https://github.com/rtlee9).

If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate if you keep the link in the footer to this project.  I've noticed that several people who forked this repo removed the attribution and I would prefer to get the recognition if you do use this :)

## Known limitations

- If you have a project page and you want a custom 404 page, you must have a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.
